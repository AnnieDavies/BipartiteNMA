# BipartiteNMA
Codes to obtain the results in the paper "The bipartite structure of treatment-trial networks reveals the flow of information in network meta-analysis" Annabel L Davies (2025)

The folder "functions" contains function definitions used in all codes. 

The folder "Application" contains the codes to obtain results for the fictional example and the real data set (plaque psoriasis). 
For the fictional example, we also include a code that shows how to obtain the various versions of the hat matrix from netmeta.

The folder "Simulation" contains the code to run the simulation study.
